# Introduction #

The ultimate goal of ObjectivEClipse is to merge back into CDT and have it published as part of Eclipse. We're a way off doing that at the moment, but it makes sense to start the preparations now rather than leaving it until the move itself.

In order to to [get involved](http://code.google.com/p/objectiveclipse/wiki/GettingInvolved), any contributions or committers must provide the code under the [Eclipse Public License](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html). In order to track who has agreed to this, and ensured that there are no rights waived, contributors are asked to agree that:


---

  * You agree to contribute the code to the this project, to be licensed as open source under the [Eclipse Public License](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)
  * You confirm that you wrote the code contributed to this project
  * You confirm that no-one else has rights to the code you contributed? (For example, did you have an agreement with an employer giving the employer rights to all code you wrote during that time but had an exclusion for Eclipse projects?)
  * You confirm that you know of no contributions to this project which were improperly copied from someone else
  * You confirm that you know of no code in this project to which a third party has rights inconsistent with the Eclipse Public License

I agree to the above conditions and confirm the above is true to the best of my knowledge

Please file an issue in the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/objectiveclipse/issues/list) of the form (userid) contribution agreement, and copy and paste the above section. Once it's fixed, we can start accepting contributions from you!
