  * Indexer. The biggest change is the syntax for Objective C classes and headers, which won't be the same as C/C++. Whether the existing lexers/indexers can be reused, or whether there's a deeper difference which can't be resolved, is unclear at this point. [Issue 2](http://code.google.com/p/objectiveclipse/issues/detail?id=2)
  * Open issues. There's a bunch of [open issues](http://code.google.com/p/objectiveclipse/issues/list)
  * Testing and new issues. Please [get involved](http://code.google.com/p/objectiveclipse/wiki/GettingInvolved)!
  * Documentation. Ultimately essential is a help document for using ObjectivEClipse.
  * PList editor (not essential for the Objective-C support, but could be useful
    * [Apache Commons has some PList code](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/configuration/trunk/src/java/org/apache/commons/configuration/plist/) that could be used to springboard this
    * [CFBinaryPList.c](http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.5.6/CF-476.17/CFBinaryPList.c) is Apple's implementation of the binary plist format (and some description)
