The first couple of milestones are feature-driven rather than time driven.

  * **0.1** Able to load, build and run a simple HelloWorld file against Mac toolchain
  * **0.2** Parser able to detect and break down Objective C code, Mylyn support
  * **0.3** Indexing on ObjC files, some code-completion

No other milestones have been planned at this stage
